If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, then why not try out craps? This fast-paced dice game can be a bit tricky to learn but once you've got the hang of it, it's great fun to play. Baccarat is another high-rolling game that can see players betting big sums of money on each hand. If you're feeling brave (or lucky), give it a go!

Caribbean Stud Poker is another recent addition to the CrazyTooth casino library and it's already proving popular with players. This variant of poker is played against the dealer rather than against other players and there's a progressive jackpot up for grabs if you manage to hit a royal flush.

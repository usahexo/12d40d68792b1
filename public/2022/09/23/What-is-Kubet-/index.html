<h1 id="What-do-the-Buffalo-Bills-play"><a href="#What-do-the-Buffalo-Bills-play" class="headerlink" title="What do the Buffalo Bills play?"></a>What do the Buffalo Bills play?</h1><p>The Buffalo Bills, a professional American football team, compete in the National Football League (NFL). The Bills play their home games at New Era Field in Orchard Park, New York.</p>
<h1 id="Who-was-Marie-Curie"><a href="#Who-was-Marie-Curie" class="headerlink" title="Who was Marie Curie?"></a>Who was Marie Curie?</h1><p>Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist who was born in Poland in 1867. Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, which she received in 1903 for her work on radiation. Curie also won a second Nobel Prize in 1911, this time for her work on radium.</p>
<p>Curie’s work on radiation changed the way we view the world and helped to create the field of nuclear physics. She also overcame many personal challenges, including the death of her husband and both of her children, in order to continue her groundbreaking research. Curie’s legacy is still felt today, and she remains an inspiration to scientists all over the world.</p>
<h1 id="What-did-she-discover"><a href="#What-did-she-discover" class="headerlink" title="What did she discover?"></a>What did she discover?</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>In 1892, a woman named Anna A. Robertson made a discovery that would change the course of histroy. Robertson, who was then just 21 years old, had been working as a stenographer in the office of the state treasurer of Illinois when she came across some documents that showed that the state had been losing money by investing in fraudulent schemes.</p>
<p>Robertson decided to take her findings to the press, and she eventually published an article about them in the Chicago Tribune. Her article created a scandal, and it led to several investigations and even some arrests. Ultimately, her work helped to expose one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-significance-of-her-discovery"><a href="#What-is-the-significance-of-her-discovery" class="headerlink" title="What is the significance of her discovery?"></a>What is the significance of her discovery?</h1><p>In 1846, Mary Anning made an incredible discovery while fossil hunting on the beaches of Lyme Regis. She found the first complete Plesiosaurus skeleton and as a result, became one of the most renowned fossil hunters of her time. Her discovery was so significant that it helped to change the way that scientists viewed prehistoric life.</p>
<p>Up until that point, most people believed that fossils were evidence of Noah’s flood. However, Anning’s discovery proved that there was a pre-existing prehistoric world which predated Christianity. This discovery helped to pave the way for the development of Darwin’s theory of evolution.</p>
<p>Anning’s work was not without controversy, however. Many of her peers were critical of her methods and accused her of being nothing more than a “country girl” who was uneducated in the ways of science. They claimed that she could not possibly have understood the significance of her findings.</p>
<p>However, Anning was determined to prove them wrong and continued to excavate fossils throughout her life. She became a mentor to other fossil hunters and helped to establish Lyme Regis as a centre for palaeontological research. Her legacy continues to be celebrated to this day.</p>

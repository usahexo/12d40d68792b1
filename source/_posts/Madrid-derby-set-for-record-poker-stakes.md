#  Madrid derby set for record poker stakes

The Madrid derby is always a hotly contested match, but this weekend's fixture is set to break new ground with stakes of €1 million (£880,000) on the table.

The two clubs have met a total of 176 times in all competitions, with Real Madrid winning 73 times and Atletico Madrid winning 43. The remaining 60 fixtures have ended in draws.

This weekend's game is the first of four meetings between the sides in 2017-18, with Atletico currently occupying second place in the Liga table and Real Madrid in third.

The stakes for this match are high as a win for either side would put them in good stead to challenge Barcelona for the title, so it's no surprise that there is such a large sum of money on the line.

While this will be a new record for Spanish poker, it's not the most money ever gambled on a football match - that accolade still belongs to an English game between Manchester United and Liverpool in October 2016 which saw £1.5 million wagered.

#  Barcelona looking to seal domestic poker triple crown

Barcelona became the first team to seal their spot in the Copa del Rey final on Wednesday night as they sealed a 5-1 aggregate win over Valencia.

Ernesto Valverde’s side were in complete control of the tie against Los Che and will now face either Real Madrid or Leganes in the final later this season.

It was Lionel Messi who got the ball rolling for Barcelona at the Mestalla, scoring his side’s opening goal after just six minutes.

Luis Suarez then doubled their advantage midway through the first half, before Messi grabbed his second of the night with a sublime free-kick shortly before half-time.

Philippe Coutinho made it 4-0 after 54 minutes, before Kevin Gameiro pulled one back for Valencia late on. However, it was only consolation for Marcelino García Toral’s side as Barcelona progressed to their 32nd Copa del Rey final.

With La Liga and the Champions League already in their trophy cabinet, Barcelona are now just one win away from completing an unprecedented domestic poker triple crown.

The Catalan giants currently sit 11 points clear at the top of La Liga with just eight games left to play, meaning they are all but guaranteed to lift their 25th league title in May.

In Europe, they have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League where they will face Liverpool over two legs next month. And with Valencia lying in wait in the final of the Copa del Rey, there is a very real chance that Barcelona could make history by becoming the first side ever to win all four major trophies in a single season.

#  Atletico Madrid eyeing historic poker double

After storming to the Europa League crown last season, Atletico Madrid have their sights set on an historic double in 2017-18.

Few clubs have ever achieved such a feat, but Diego Simeone’s side look well placed to make a serious challenge for La Liga and European glory.

Atleti got their league campaign off to the perfect start with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Deportivo La Coruna, with Antoine Griezmann scoring the only goal of the game.

The Frenchman has been in superb form in pre-season and will be looking to replicate his goalscoring exploits from last year.

Griezmann was ably supported by Saul Niguez and Koke in attack against Deportivo, and the trio could cause havoc for opposition defences throughout the season.

Defensively, Atletico are typically solid and they should again be one of the main contenders for the La Liga title.

 Jan Oblak is one of the best goalkeepers in Europe and he is surrounded by a number of quality defenders, including Diego Godin, Lucas Hernandez and Filipe Luis.

Simeone’s side are likely to face stiff competition from Barcelona and Real Madrid for the La Liga crown, but they will be confident of at least finishing in the top four this season.

As for their Champions League prospects, Atletico will be quietly confident of progressing beyond their group stage. Monaco, Borussia Dortmund and Club Brugge represent a tricky test but Simeone’s men should be capable of overcoming them all.


In the latter stages of the competition, anything can happen as we saw last season when Manchester City were knocked out by Monaco despite being heavy favourites heading into the tie.

#  Real Madrid enter rarefied air with 10th consecutive La Liga poker win

_Real Madrid entered rarefied air on Saturday, winning their 10th consecutive La Liga match with a 3-1 victory at home to Athletic Bilbao. With the victory, Los Blancos moved six points clear of second-place Atletico Madrid and nine points clear of Barcelona, who have a game in hand. It is only the second time in club history that Real Madrid have achieved such a feat in La Liga._

 Santiago Bernabeu Stadium has been a fortress for Los Blancos this season, with only one league defeat suffered at home all season. Saturday’s win against Athletic Bilbao was achieved without the help of Cristiano Ronaldo, who was serving the first of his five-game suspension.

 Goals from Isco, Gareth Bale and Marco Asensio were enough to seal all three points for Real Madrid on Saturday. The win also means that Real Madrid have now won 18 consecutive matches in all competitions – equalling their club record set in 2016.

With 10 matches remaining in La Liga, it is looking increasingly likely that Real Madrid will be crowned champions for the first time since 2012. Zinedine Zidane’s men face Malaga next weekend before taking on Napoli in the Champions League round of 16.

#  Could Valencia upset the odds and gatecrash the poker top four?

The European Poker Tour (EPT) is well and truly underway, with the latest stop - the PokerStars Championship Barcelona - in full swing. The tournament has seen some huge names take to the felt, but as ever there are a few dark horses lurking in the pack, looking to upset the odds.

Perhaps one of the most intriguing players in this year's field is Spanish prodigy Sergio Aido. The youngster has been making waves on the tour for a few years now, and his recent victory at the EPT13 Dublin Main Event sees him arrive in Barcelona in fine form.

Aido is by no means a sure thing, but he does have an impressive record on European soil and could be well worth keeping an eye on over the coming days. Another player who could cause a stir is Valentin Messina. The Frenchman already has one title to his name this season and knows how to win big tournaments.

Elsewhere, American poker superstar Bryn Kenney will be looking to add to his already impressive CV, and he's sure to be one of the favourites going into the event. Swedish veteran Martin Jacobson is another player who can never be discounted, while young British talent Chris Moorman will also be looking to make his mark on the tour.

With so many big names in attendance, it's sure to be a thrilling week of poker in Barcelona. Who will come out on top? Only time will tell!

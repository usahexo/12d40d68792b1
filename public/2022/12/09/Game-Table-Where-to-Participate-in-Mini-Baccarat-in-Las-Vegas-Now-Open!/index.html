<p>The Curie Casino is now open to mini baccarat players. The casino, which is operated by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, opened its doors to mini baccarat players on Monday, July 10th. The new game offers players a chance to win up to $10,000 per hand.</p>
<p>Mini baccarat is a variation of the traditional card game that is played with six decks of cards. In the game, the dealer deals two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to themselves. The goal of the game is to get as close as possible to nine points without going over. Points are counted as follows: cards 2 through 9 are worth their face value, 10s and face cards (jacks, queens and kings) are worth zero points, and an ace is worth one point.</p>
<p>If either player has eight or nine points after their first two cards are dealt, they stand (or stay). If neither player has eight or nine points after their first two cards are dealt, then the third card is turned over (the turn-up card). If the turn-up card is an eight or nine then both players automatically stand. If the turn-up card is anything else then the player takes another card (called drawing). The player’s total score is then calculated and bets are paid out accordingly.</p>
<p>The minimum bet in mini baccarat is $5 and the maximum bet is $500. However, some casinos may have higher betting limits.</p>
<h1 id="Come-Out-and-Play-Mini-Baccarat-at-Curie-Casino"><a href="#Come-Out-and-Play-Mini-Baccarat-at-Curie-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Come Out and Play Mini Baccarat at Curie Casino!"></a>Come Out and Play Mini Baccarat at Curie Casino!</h1><p>Mini Baccarat is one of the most popular table games at Curie Casino. It’s also one of the simplest – which is why it’s quick to learn and perfect for newcomers as well as seasoned casino players.</p>
<p>The game is played with six decks of cards, which are shuffled together before each game. The dealer deals two cards face up to each player, and two cards face down (the banker’s hand). The aim of Mini Baccarat is to get as close to nine as possible with the two cards you hold.</p>
<p>If you want to bet on the player hand, simply bet on the ‘player’ box on your betting slip. If you want to bet on the banker hand, bet on the ‘banker’ box instead. You can also wager on a tie, but this pays out at 8-1 odds so it’s not generally recommended.</p>
<p>Once all bets have been placed, the dealer will turn over the banker’s cards. If their total is eight or nine then they stand (no further cards are drawn). If their total is less than five then they take another card automatically. If their total is six or seven then they must take another card unless both player cards also add up to six or seven (in which case the banker stands).</p>
<p>The same process applies to the player hand – if their total is eight or nine they stand, and if their total is less than five they automatically take another card. In cases where both hands are equal (e.g. a four and a three), the result is called a ‘tie’ and no one wins or loses money on that particular round.</p>
<p>The beauty of Mini Baccarat is that there are very few decisions that need to be made, so it’s easy to follow along even if you’re not used to playing casino games. This makes it perfect for beginners, but there’s still plenty of strategy involved for experienced players too. So come out and play Mini Baccarat at Curie Casino today!</p>

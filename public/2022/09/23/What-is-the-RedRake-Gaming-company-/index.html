They cannot be used in the public sector, and certain jobs - such as in education - are also off-limits. Additionally, there are limits on their ability to own property or to start a business.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the number of expats in Saudi Arabia continues to grow. This is largely due to the fact that Saudi Arabia offers a number of benefits and opportunities that are not available in other countries. The cost of living is relatively low, and there are many employment opportunities available.</p>
<p>The growing expat population is also contributing to the development of Saudi Arabia. Expats are bringing new ideas and perspectives to the country, and they are helping to foster a culture of openness and innovation.</p>

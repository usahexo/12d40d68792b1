#  Are there any restrictions on their use?

There are a few restrictions on the use of expats. They cannot be used in the public sector, and certain jobs - such as in education - are also off-limits. Additionally, there are limits on their ability to own property or to start a business.

Despite these limitations, the number of expats in Saudi Arabia continues to grow. This is largely due to the fact that Saudi Arabia offers a number of benefits and opportunities that are not available in other countries. The cost of living is relatively low, and there are many employment opportunities available.

The growing expat population is also contributing to the development of Saudi Arabia. Expats are bringing new ideas and perspectives to the country, and they are helping to foster a culture of openness and innovation.

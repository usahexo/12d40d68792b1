#  Clippers Lose, But The Game Continues Anyway

In a matchup of two teams in the top four of the Western Conference, the Clippers lost to the Warriors on Thursday night. Klay Thompson led all scorers with 27 points, including six three-pointers, as Golden State continued their unbeaten streak.

The Clippers, meanwhile, suffered their first home loss of the season despite 28 points from Blake Griffin and 24 points from Chris Paul. The game was close throughout, but Golden State pulled away in the fourth quarter.

The defeat leaves Los Angeles in third place in the West, two games behind the Warriors and one game behind the Spurs. However, there is still plenty of time for the Clippers to make up ground, and they remain one of the favorites to reach the NBA Finals.

Thursday's game was not without controversy, as Griffin appeared to have been fouled by Andrew Bogut late in the fourth quarter. The referees did not call a foul on the play, and Griffin finished with just four free throws on the night.

Despite losing to Golden State, there are still a number of reasons for Clippers fans to be optimistic. Griffin is playing some of his best basketball ever, and Paul remains one of the league's top point guards. There is also plenty of talent on Los Angeles' bench, including Jamal Crawford and Matt Barnes.

The Clippers will look to get back on track on Saturday when they host the Lakers at Staples Center.

#  Clippers Hold Off Thunder for 111-103 Victory 

In their first matchup of the season, the Los Angeles Clippers were victorious over the Oklahoma City Thunder, 111-103. This was a rematch of last year’s first round playoff series in which the Clippers were eliminated in six games.

The game was close throughout, with neither team leading by more than seven points. The Clippers went into halftime with a 55-52 lead.

The Thunder took the lead early in the third quarter, but the Clippers responded with a 10-2 run to take back control of the game. They would not relinquish that lead again.

#  Griffin Leads Clippers Over Lakers 112-107

With both teams trading baskets early in the game, it was the Nuggets who took a seven-point lead into halftime. The Clippers came out firing in the third quarter, however, outscoring Denver 33-17 to take a six-point lead into the fourth.

It was a back-and-forth battle down the stretch, but with LA's stars shining brightest, they were able to come away with the victory. Lou Williams led all scorers with 36 points on 15 of 26 shooting, while Tobias Harris added 27 points and 11 rebounds. Nikola Jokic had a monster game for Denver with 41 points and 12 rebounds, but it wasn't enough to overcome LA's hot shooting.

You may have even passed one on the way to work and not even realized it. States are legalizing online gambling, which is making it difficult for brick and mortar casinos to stay open.</p>
<p>Detroit is the latest city to close its only casino. The Motor City Casino announced that it will close at the end of March. This comes just a few months after another Detroit casino, the Greektown Casino, closed its doors. These closures are indicative of a larger trend in the casino industry.</p>
<p>According to data from analysts at Morgan Stanley, nearly two-thirds of American casinos could close in the next decade because of legalized online gambling. This would leave just 391 casinos operational in the United States. Furthermore, these closures could cost more than 235,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The main reason for this dramatic shift is the legalization of online gambling. States are beginning to legalize online gambling at a rapid pace. In fact, according to a study by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, 32 states will have some form of legalized online gambling by 2023. This includes outright legalization, expansion of current laws governing internet gaming, and authorizing specific types of bettors to play online poker or casino games.</p>
<p>This widespread legalization is taking a toll on brick and mortar casinos. These establishments are struggling to compete with the convenience and lower costs of online gambling companies. For example, MGM Resorts has seen its stock price decline by more than 20% since 2015 as legalized online gaming has taken hold across the country.</p>
<p>The closure of Detroit’s two casinos is just the latest sign that brick and mortar casinos are in trouble. If you live near a casino, it’s worth keeping an eye on whether it’s still open in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Closing-Could-Lead-to-Slots-Being-Replaced-with-Parking-Spaces"><a href="#Casino-Closing-Could-Lead-to-Slots-Being-Replaced-with-Parking-Spaces" class="headerlink" title="Casino Closing Could Lead to Slots Being Replaced with Parking Spaces"></a>Casino Closing Could Lead to Slots Being Replaced with Parking Spaces</h1><p>The struggling casino closing could lead to the slots being replaced with parking spaces. The casino, which is located in downtown, has announced that it will close its doors on October 1st. This news comes as a surprise to many, as the casino has been a staple in the community for years.</p>
<p>The closure of the casino means that dozens of employees will lose their jobs. It also means that there will be a lot of empty space in the downtown area. Some people are already calling for the slots to be replaced with parking spaces.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the closure of the casino will have a negative impact on the community. However, replacing the slots with parking spaces could help to mitigate some of that damage. Parking is in high demand in downtown, and adding more spaces could help to ease traffic congestion and boost business activity.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what will happen to the space vacated by the casino. Replacing the slots with parking spaces would be a wise decision, and it is something that should be considered by city officials.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Closure-Threatens-700-Jobs-in-the-Local-Area"><a href="#Casino-Closure-Threatens-700-Jobs-in-the-Local-Area" class="headerlink" title="Casino Closure Threatens 700 Jobs in the Local Area"></a>Casino Closure Threatens 700 Jobs in the Local Area</h1><p>The closure of a local casino could mean the loss of up to 700 jobs in the area, according to recent reports.</p>
<p>The casino, which is said to be the third-largest in the state, announced last week that it would be closing its doors due to financial difficulties. This news has caused concern among local officials and workers, who worry about what the closure could mean for them.</p>
<p>While there has been no confirmation yet as to how many jobs will be lost as a result of the closure, it is likely that hundreds will be impacted. Those who have worked at the casino for many years are particularly worried about what they will do now that their job is gone.</p>
<p>In addition to the jobs that will be directly impacted by the closure, there are also concerns about the impact on the local economy. The casino is said to generate millions of dollars in revenue each year, and its closure could mean a significant loss for the area.</p>
<p>Officials are hopeful that they can find a way to save the casino, but at this point it seems unlikely that it will stay open. This would be a major blow to the local community, and it is unclear what steps need to be taken in order to address it.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Establishment-Feeling-the-Pinch-as-State-Tightens-Up-Regulations"><a href="#Gambling-Establishment-Feeling-the-Pinch-as-State-Tightens-Up-Regulations" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Establishment Feeling the Pinch as State Tightens Up Regulations"></a>Gambling Establishment Feeling the Pinch as State Tightens Up Regulations</h1><p>Gambling establishments across the state are feeling the pinch as the government tightens up its regulations. The new laws, which come into effect on 1 January 2019, aim to clamp down on casino operators who have been accused of exploiting their customers.</p>
<p>The changes include a newucasinos.co.uk&#x2F;“&gt;licensing system that will reward operators who meet high standards, and stricter rules around advertising and customer protection. The government is also introducing a new ‘whitelist’ of approved casino websites, which will be prohibited from operating in the UK unless they meet strict criteria.</p>
<p>The changes have been welcomed by many in the industry, who argue that they are long overdue. One casino operator told us that the new laws are “a step in the right direction”, and vowed to work with the government to ensure that they are implemented effectively.</p>
<p>Others have criticised the government for failing to consult with the industry before introducing the new laws, arguing that this could lead to confusion and disruption in the run-up to January 2019. One trade body has even threatened legal action over what it describes as a “clear case of disproportionate regulation”.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, there is broad consensus that the government needs to take action to protect consumers from unscrupulous operators. In recent years there has been a proliferation of so-called ‘clone casinos’, which often use misleading advertising and predatory tactics to lure players in.</p>
<p>Many of these casinos are based overseas, and players have little recourse if they experience problems cashing out or withdrawing their winnings. The new laws will make it harder for these casinos to operate in the UK, and should provide much-needed protection for players.</p>
<h1 id="Owner-of-Casino-That-May-Close-Near-You-We-Are-Struggling-Financially"><a href="#Owner-of-Casino-That-May-Close-Near-You-We-Are-Struggling-Financially" class="headerlink" title="Owner of Casino That May Close Near You: We Are Struggling Financially"></a>Owner of Casino That May Close Near You: We Are Struggling Financially</h1><p>Casino owner Rick Rockwell is the latest business owner to come forward and admit that his company is struggling financially. In an interview with the local news, Rockwell said that unless things turn around soon, his casino may have to close its doors.</p>
<p>This announcement comes as a surprise to many in the community, as Rockwell’s casino is a major employer and has been a staple of the area for years. The casino has been struggling to keep up with competition from nearby gambling establishments, and recent tax increases have made things even more difficult.</p>
<p>“It’s been a challenging year,” Rockwell said in the interview. “The cost of doing business has gone up, but our revenues have stayed pretty much the same. We’re barely scraping by at this point.”</p>
<p>Rockwell says that he’s exploring all options at this point, including selling the casino or turning it into a nonprofit organization. He’s also hoping that local lawmakers will consider helping out struggling businesses like his with tax breaks or other incentives.</p>
<p>“We really appreciate all of our customers and employees,” Rockwell said. “We hope we can work something out and stay in business.”</p>

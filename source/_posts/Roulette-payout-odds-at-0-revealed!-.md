#  Roulette payout odds at 0 revealed! 

There are a few important things to know when betting on roulette. The first is the house edge. This is the percentage of each bet that the casino keeps, regardless of the outcome. For American roulette, it’s 5.26%. 

The second thing to be aware of is the different types of bets and their payout odds. There are inside bets and outside bets. The latter are bets made on the table’s perimeter, while the former are placed on specific numbers or groups of numbers. 

The odds for various payout amounts are as follows: 

1-to-1 (Straight up): 36 chances to win, 1 to lose
2-to-1 (Split): 18 chances to win, 2 to lose
3-to-1 (Street): 12 chances to win, 3 to lose

#  How much money can you expect to win when betting on the number 0? 

There is no one definitive answer to this question. In fact, it depends on a number of factors, including the type of bet you make, the odds for that particular bet, and how much money you are wagering.

However, in general, when betting on the number 0 at even odds, you can expect to win about 50% of your bets. This means that if you wager $10 on the number 0 in any given instance, then you can expect to win an average of $5.

Of course, these figures will vary depending on the specific situation. For example, if you are betting on a particularly low-odds number 0 bet, then your expected winnings will be lower. Conversely, if the odds are particularly high, then your expected winnings will be higher.

In short, there is no one definitive answer to this question. However, by understanding the basics of gambling mathematics, you can get a good idea of what to expect when betting on any particular number.

#  Discover which roulette games offer the best odds for a payout on 0! 

The odds of hitting a 0 in roulette are 18.5 to 1, but some games offer better odds than others. 

European roulette has better odds for players than American roulette does, because the European game has only one 0 on the wheel. American roulette has two zeroes-0 and 00-so your chances of winning when betting on a single number are actually 36 to 1, rather than the standard 38 to 1. 

That said, if you're playing with a Bonus Bet that covers numbers 0-3-6-9, then the house edge is reduced to just 2.7%. So if you're looking to maximize your chances of winning on a 0 payout, then look for a game with a Bonus Bet option. 

Some games also offer side bets which can increase your odds of winning even further. For example, the Roulette Royal game offered by RealTime Gaming casinos offers a payout of 1000:1 on a bet made on zero!

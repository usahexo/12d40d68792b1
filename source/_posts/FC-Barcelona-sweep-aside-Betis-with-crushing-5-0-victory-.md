#  FC Barcelona sweep aside Betis with crushing 5-0 victory 

FC Barcelona recorded an emphatic 5-0 victory over Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday night. Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick, and Lionel Messi and Philippe Coutinho also got on the scoresheet as the Catalans maintained their perfect start to the season.

 Ernesto Valverde’s side took the lead after just five minutes, when Suarez headed in from Jordi Alba’s cross. The Uruguay striker made it 2-0 shortly before half-time, firing into the bottom corner after being set up by Messi.

Coutinho added a third early in the second half, and Suarez completed his hat-trick with two more goals in the closing stages. It was an impressive performance from Barcelona, who have now won all six of their matches in La Liga this season.

The result leaves them four points clear at the top of the table, ahead of rivals Atletico Madrid and Sevilla. Next up for Valverde’s side is a home clash against Girona on Wednesday evening.

#  Ronaldo scores stunning hat-trick as Real Madrid thump Betis 5-1 

Real Madrid moved up to third in La Liga after a 5-1 rout of Betis on Saturday, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a stunning hat-trick.

Ronaldo opened the scoring after just eight minutes, volleying home from close range after Gareth Bale had flicked on a long ball from Luka Modric.

The Portugal international doubled his tally in the 20th minute, curling a sumptuous free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards out.

Betis were offered some hope shortly before half-time when Darko Brasanac pulled one back, but Ronaldo put the game to bed with two goals in three minutes after the break.

 His first was a simple tap-in following good work down the right by Benzema and Bale, and he completed his hat-trick in the 63rd minute, firing low into the bottom corner after being set up by Isco.

Victory sees Madrid move above Valencia and up to third place, four points behind Atletico Madrid and six adrift of leaders Barcelona.

#  Philippe Coutinho nets first goal for Barcelona in 5-0 win over Betis 

 Philippe Coutinho netted his first goal for Barcelona in a 5-0 victory over Real Betis on Sunday. The Brazilian international, who moved to Barca from Liverpool in January, scored with a superb curling effort from the edge of the area in the 67th minute.

Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez also found the net for Ernesto Valverde's side, as they maintained their unbeaten start to the La Liga season. Betis had begun the game brightly and had a good chance to take the lead early on when Junior Firpo's header was turned onto the post by goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

However, Barca gradually took control and created several good chances before finally breaking through shortly after the hour mark. Messi added a second goal in stoppage time and Suarez completed the rout in injury time, meaning that Barcelona have now scored at least five goals in each of their last four games in all competitions.

#  Marc Bartra brace helps Borussia Dortmund beat Real Betis 5-2

Marc Bartra scored his first goal for Borussia Dortmund in the 5-2 Bundesliga win over Real Betis.

Mario Gotze, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shinji Kagawa also scored for Dortmund, who moved to within two points of second-placed Schalke. Betis remain seventh after a disastrous outing in which they were three goals down by halftime.

"We're back on track," said Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger. "The players have shown that they've put the Champions League fiasco behind them."

Dortmund lost 3-1 at home to Tottenham Hotspur in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie on Wednesday.

"Today we played very concentrated football and deserved to win," added Stoeger.

Bartra's moment of glory came in the 26th minute when he volleyed home from close range after a corner from captain Marco Reus. It was the first time the Spain international had found the net since scoring for Borussia Monchengladbach against Hertha Berlin in April 2016.

Gotze made it 2-0 four minutes later with a clinical finish after being set up by Reus, and Sokratis headed home Dortmund's third in the 36th minute after another pinpoint cross from Reus. Kagawa got on the scoresheet two minutes into first-half stoppage time, stabbing the ball past Betis goalkeeper Antonio Adan after being played through by Achraf Hakimi.

Adan pulled one back for Betis with a superb long-range strike in the 59th minute, but substitute Maximilian Philipp restored Dortmund's four-goal cushion 10 minutes from time with a looping header from Marcel Schmelzer's cross.

            <h1 id="Clippers-Lose-But-The-Game-Continues-Anyway"><a href="#Clippers-Lose-But-The-Game-Continues-Anyway" class="headerlink" title="Clippers Lose, But The Game Continues Anyway"></a>Clippers Lose, But The Game Continues Anyway</h1><p>In a matchup of two teams in the top four of the Western Conference, the Clippers lost to the Warriors on Thursday night. Klay Thompson led all scorers with 27 points, including six three-pointers, as Golden State continued their unbeaten streak.</p>
<p>The Clippers, meanwhile, suffered their first home loss of the season despite 28 points from Blake Griffin and 24 points from Chris Paul. The game was close throughout, but Golden State pulled away in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The defeat leaves Los Angeles in third place in the West, two games behind the Warriors and one game behind the Spurs. However, there is still plenty of time for the Clippers to make up ground, and they remain one of the favorites to reach the NBA Finals.</p>
<p>Thursday’s game was not without controversy, as Griffin appeared to have been fouled by Andrew Bogut late in the fourth quarter. The referees did not call a foul on the play, and Griffin finished with just four free throws on the night.</p>
<p>Despite losing to Golden State, there are still a number of reasons for Clippers fans to be optimistic. Griffin is playing some of his best basketball ever, and Paul remains one of the league’s top point guards. There is also plenty of talent on Los Angeles’ bench, including Jamal Crawford and Matt Barnes.</p>
<p>The Clippers will look to get back on track on Saturday when they host the Lakers at Staples Center.</p>
<h1 id="Sixth-Man-Comes-Up-Big-for-Clippers-in-Overtime-Victory"><a href="#Sixth-Man-Comes-Up-Big-for-Clippers-in-Overtime-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Sixth Man Comes Up Big for Clippers in Overtime Victory"></a>Sixth Man Comes Up Big for Clippers in Overtime Victory</h1><p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Lou Williams scored 33 points, and the Clippers beat the Charlotte Hornets 126-121 in overtime Monday night.</p>
<p>The Clippers’ sixth man shot 10 for 18 from the field, including 5 for 10 on 3-pointers, and made all 12 of his free throws.</p>
<p>“Lou was great,” said Clippers coach Doc Rivers. “He hit some big shots.”</p>
<p>Williams scored 14 points in the fourth quarter and six in overtime.</p>
<p>“When it comes to crunch time, I love having the ball in my hands,” said Williams. “I was just trying to be aggressive.”</p>
<p>Blake Griffin had 27 points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who have won three of four since losing five in a row. DeAndre Jordan had 17 points and 19 rebounds.</p>
<p>Dwight Howard led Charlotte with 29 points and 13 rebounds. Kemba Walker added 28 points and seven assists. Nicolas Batum had 17 points and 11 rebounds.</p>
<h1 id="Clippers-Hold-Off-Thunder-for-111-103-Victory"><a href="#Clippers-Hold-Off-Thunder-for-111-103-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Clippers Hold Off Thunder for 111-103 Victory"></a>Clippers Hold Off Thunder for 111-103 Victory</h1><p>In their first matchup of the season, the Los Angeles Clippers were victorious over the Oklahoma City Thunder, 111-103. This was a rematch of last year’s first round playoff series in which the Clippers were eliminated in six games.</p>
<p>The game was close throughout, with neither team leading by more than seven points. The Clippers went into halftime with a 55-52 lead.</p>
<p>The Thunder took the lead early in the third quarter, but the Clippers responded with a 10-2 run to take back control of the game. They would not relinquish that lead again.</p>
<p>Blake Griffin led all scorers with 33 points on 12-of-21 shooting. Chris Paul added 27 points and 11 assists, and DeAndre Jordan had 14 points and 16 rebounds. For the Thunder, Russell Westbrook had 28 points, 10 assists, and eight rebounds, and Kevin Durant added 25 points.</p>
<p>This win improves the Clippers record to 2-1 on the season. They will next play on Wednesday night against the Denver Nuggets.</p>
<h1 id="Griffin-Leads-Clippers-Over-Lakers-112-107"><a href="#Griffin-Leads-Clippers-Over-Lakers-112-107" class="headerlink" title="Griffin Leads Clippers Over Lakers 112-107"></a>Griffin Leads Clippers Over Lakers 112-107</h1><p>In a matchup of two of the most exciting teams in the NBA, it was the Clippers who came out on top 112-107. The Lakers had no answer for Blake Griffin, who led all scorers with 38 points on 16-of-25 shooting.</p>
<p>Griffin was especially impressive in the fourth quarter, when he scored 14 points to help seal the victory for the Clippers. DeAndre Jordan added 18 points and 16 rebounds for Los Angeles, while Chris Paul chipped in with 16 points and 14 assists.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant led the Lakers with 34 points, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Griffin and the rest of the Clippers. Pau Gasol added 20 points and 10 rebounds for Los Angeles, while Dwight Howard finished with 18 points and 15 rebounds.</p>
<h1 id="Lob-City-Heats-Up-In-Second-Half-to-Take-Down-the-Nuggets"><a href="#Lob-City-Heats-Up-In-Second-Half-to-Take-Down-the-Nuggets" class="headerlink" title="Lob City Heats Up In Second Half to Take Down the Nuggets"></a>Lob City Heats Up In Second Half to Take Down the Nuggets</h1><p>The Los Angeles Clippers continued their strong play in the second half, outscoring the Denver Nuggets 34-25 in the fourth quarter to take the game 123-118.</p>
<p>With both teams trading baskets early in the game, it was the Nuggets who took a seven-point lead into halftime. The Clippers came out firing in the third quarter, however, outscoring Denver 33-17 to take a six-point lead into the fourth.</p>
<p>It was a back-and-forth battle down the stretch, but with LA’s stars shining brightest, they were able to come away with the victory. Lou Williams led all scorers with 36 points on 15 of 26 shooting, while Tobias Harris added 27 points and 11 rebounds. Nikola Jokic had a monster game for Denver with 41 points and 12 rebounds, but it wasn’t enough to overcome LA’s hot shooting.</p>

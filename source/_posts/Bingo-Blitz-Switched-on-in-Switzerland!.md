#  The Swiss get their Bingo On!

The Bingo Association of Switzerland (BAS) is the official organization responsible for the regulation and promotion of bingo in Switzerland. They organize tournaments, manage licenses, and work with the government to ensure a positive environment for bingo players.

In early 2017, the BAS announced they were changing their regulations to allow Swiss shelters to host bingo events on behalf of charity organizations. The decision was made in an effort to support homeless and vulnerable populations in the country.

Up until this change, shelters were not allowed to host bingo events as they were considered places of entertainment rather than charity. With this new regulation, shelters are now able to offer a fun event for their guests while also raising money for a good cause.

The shelter hosting the event can keep up to 20% of the proceeds from ticket sales, with the remaining 80% going to the charity organization. This change is hoped to generate around 5,000 francs per year for charities working with at-risk populations.

So far, reactions to this change have been positive. Players are excited about the possibility of playing bingo in a more relaxed setting and giving back to those in need. Charities are happy about having another opportunity to fundraise and help those who need it most. And the BAS is pleased with how things are going so far and looks forward to continuing to work with shelters throughout Switzerland.

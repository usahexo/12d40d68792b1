Since the release of the Diamond Casino DLC update, many GTA Online players have been asking what new content it includes. The update includes a new casino game called Diamonds Scratch, as well as new vehicles and clothing.

The Diamonds Scratch game is a bit like a scratch card lottery. You can buy tickets for $100,000 each, and then scratch off three panels to see if you've won. If you match two of the same symbols, you'll win that prize amount. The biggest prize is 1 million dollars, but there are also smaller prizes such as $10 and $50.

Along with the Diamonds Scratch game, the DLC update adds two new vehicles: the Invetero Coquette Classic and the Ocelot Jackal. The Coquette Classic is a classic sports car, while the Jackal is an off-road vehicle. There are also six new clothing items available in the update: three hats, two jackets, and a shirt.

So far, players seem to be enjoying the new content in the DLC update. The Diamonds Scratch game is a lot of fun, and the new vehicles and clothing look great. Rockstar has done a great job with this update!
